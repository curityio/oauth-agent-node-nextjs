# Architecture of the OAuth Agent

## Overview

Node and the [Next.js framework](https://nextjs.org) are used to build the OAuth Agent. The easiest way to deploy a Next.js app is to use the
[Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/import) from the creators of Next.js. Check out [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment)
for more details. The API handles token responses from an Authorization Server, then saves encrypted tokens in http-only cookies.
The API is therefore stateless and easy to manage, and does not require a database. The SPA can then use secure cookies to call
business APIs, or to get userinfo from this API.

## Endpoints

The API exposes the following endpoints to the SPA:

1. POST `/login/start`
2. POST `/login/end`
3. GET `/userInfo`
4. GET `/claims`
5. POST `/refresh`
6. POST `/logout`

### POST `/login/start`

This endpoint is used to initialize an authorization request. The API responds with a URL which the SPA should navigate to in order to start the authorization flow at the Authorization Server. The URL returned can contain query parameters or be a JAR or PAR URL. However, the format of the URL is irrelevant to the SPA, it should just redirect the user to that URL.

The API responds with a JSON containing the `authorizationRequestUrl` field.

#### Example request

`POST https://api.example.com/oauth-agent/login/start`

Response:
```json
{
  "authorizationRequestUrl": "https://idsvr.example.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=spa-client&response_type=code&scope=openid%20read&redirect_uri=https://www.example.com/"
}
```

If required, the SPA can POST an object with an extra params field containing runtime OpenID Connect parameters.\
They key and value of each item must be strings. They will be appended to the request URL.

```json
{
  "extraParams": [
      {
          "key": "max-age",
          "value": "3600",
      },
      {
          "key": "ui_locales",
          "value": "fr",
      },
  ]
}
```

### POST `/login/end`

This endpoint should be called by the SPA on any page load. The SPA sends the current URL to the API, which can either finish the authorization flow (if it was a response from the Authorization Server), or inform the SPA whether the user is logged in or not (based on the presence of secure cookies).

#### Example request

```http
POST https://api.example.com/oauth-agent/login/end
pageUrl=http://www.example.com?code=abcdef&state=qwerty
```

The response will contain a few `Set-Cookie` headers.

### GET `/userInfo`

Endpoint which sends the access token to the user info endpoint, then returns data.

#### Example

```http
GET https://api.example.com/oauth-agent/userInfo
Cookie: example-at=2558e7806c0523fd96d105...
```

Response

```json
{
  "sub": "0abd0b16b309a3a034af8494aa0092aa42813e635f194c795df5006db90743e8",
  "preferred_username": "demouser",
  "given_name": "Demo",
  "updated_at": 1627313147,
  "family_name": "User"
}
```

### GET `/claims`

Endpoint which returns claims of the ID token contained in the session cookie.

#### Example

```http
GET https://api.example.com/oauth-agent/claims
Cookie: example-id=2558e7806c0523fd96d105...
```

Response

```json
{
  "exp":1626263589,
  "nbf":1626259989,
  "jti":"34e76304-0bc3-46ee-bc70-e21685eb5282",
  "iss":"https://idsvr.example.com/oauth",
  "aud":"spa-client",
  "sub":"0abd0b16b309a3a034af8494aa0092aa42813e635f194c795df5006db90743e8",
  "auth_time":1626259937,
  "iat":1626259989
}
```

### POST `/refresh`

This endpoint can be called to force the API to refresh the access token. If the API is able to perform the refresh new cookies will be set in the response (which is a 204 response), otherwise the API will respond with a 401 response (e.g. when the refresh token is expired) to inform the SPA that a new login is required. 

### POST `/logout`

This endpoint can be called to get a logout URL. The SPA should navigate the user to that URL in order to perform a logout in the Authorization Server. The API also sets empty session cookies in the response.

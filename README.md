## Overview

The OAuth Agent acts as a modern `Back End for Front End (BFF)` for Single Page Applications.\
This implementation demonstrates the standard pattern for SPAs:

- Strongest browser security with only `SameSite=strict` cookies
- The OpenID Connect flow uses Authorization Code Flow (PKCE) and a client secret

## Architecture

The following endpoints are used so that the SPA uses simple one-liners to perform its OAuth work:

| Endpoint          | Description                                                                          |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| POST /login/start | Start a login by providing the request URL to the SPA and setting temporary cookies. |
| POST /login/end   | Complete a login and issuing secure cookies for the SPA containing encrypted tokens. |
| GET /userInfo     | Return information from the User Info endpoint for the SPA to display.               |
| GET /claims       | Return ID token claims such as `auth_time` and `acr`.                                |
| POST /refresh     | Refresh an access token and rewrite cookies.                                         |
| POST /logout      | Clear cookies and return an end session request URL.                                 |

For further details see the [Architecture](/doc/Architecture.md) article.

## OAuth Agent Development

See the [Setup](/doc/Setup.md) article for details on productive OAuth Agent development.\
This enables a test driven approach to developing the OAuth Agent, without the need for a browser.

## End-to-End SPA Flow

See the below article for details on how to run the end-to-end solution in a browser:

- [SPA Code Example](https://curity.io/resources/learn/token-handler-spa-example/)

The end-to-end solution, by default, uses our Express implementation of the OAuth Agent. If you want to run it with this Next.js implementation,
then a few things would have to be changed manually in the build and deployment scripts.

## Website Documentation
